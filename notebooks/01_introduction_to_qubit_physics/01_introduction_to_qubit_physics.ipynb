    "To understand how qubits are controlled to implement quantum gates, we first need to examine the qubit's physical system. In this notebook, we will see how a qubit is encoded in superconducting circuits, which approximations can be used depending on our goals, what effects arise from the interactions with the thermal bath, how the qubit-resonator interaction enables measurements, and how to define the parameters of this systems in OpenPulse."

    "A **qubit** is any system that can be escribed by a two-dimensional Hilbert space, $\\mathbb{C}^2$. Usually, we denote by $\\{\\ket{0},\\ket{1}\\}$ an orthonormal basis, so any arbitrary **qubit state** can be described as:\n",

    "From here, we can derive all the arithmetic used in quantum computing, but the focus of this course will be on how to encode this space in a real physical system and how to implement the unitary gates used in quantum circuits. Specifically, we'll see how the qubits are encoded it transmons, also called charge-qubits.<br>\n",

    "The LC circuit is a basic case where we can define a qubit, this circuit consists on a capacitor and an inductor that exchange their electric and magnetic energies in the same way as a harmonic oscillator. In fact, for the superconducting regime of an LC circuit, we can describe its energy as a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO):\n",

    "A qubit encoding could be performed by restricting to a subspace generated by two of these eigenstates, for example, the conveniently numbered $\\{\\ket{0},\\ket{1}\\}$, which correspond to the ground and first excited states of the oscillator. As the energy is an observable, in theory we could measure it, collapsing the system to either $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ for any superposition of them, and we could also transition between them by applying energy pulses (photons) with the appropriate energy given by the resonance frequency."
